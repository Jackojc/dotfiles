# TODO
- Prompt before installing nix or list of packages
- Namespaced scripts (generic wrapper for bemenu that opens with pre-filter for i.e. power related scripts)
- Use generic name for launching wayland
- Use a river tiling script
- Fix issue with bemenu where left side has opaque background (open bemenu on bright background)
- Find better status bar
- Screenshot aliases for slurp and grim
- Setup git so we can push changes for dotfiles
- Maybe switch XDG_DESKTOP vars to sway instead of river, might improve compatibility
- Prompt on exit application
- Allow foot to open in CWD from previous instance
- On-screen display for volume/brightness etc.
- Deduplicate root volume
- Status bar should remain visible while in an alternate keybinding group and then automatically hide when returning to normal mode
