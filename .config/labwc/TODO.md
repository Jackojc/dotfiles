# TODO
- differences between frame/client
- differences between title/titlebar
- differences between action=press action=click
- pipe menus
- how to authenticate to run tasks as root from menu
- menu separators
- menu labels (without function)
- window rules
- more ways to tile (?)
- better navigation between windows

- restrict alt-tab to current display if possible
- keybinds to shrink size
- moving window to smaller display makes it go off screen edges (can we set an action to set its size?)
- xfce panel
- keep-running script which checks if something is running and then loops
- vertically/horizontally locked resize with mouse
- fix pass through of w-tab for w-s-tab
- snap-to-edge, can we make it snap to remaining space instead of always 50% (maybe we can also highlight this way too)
- fix snapping to window edge across displays
- mouse scroll resize
